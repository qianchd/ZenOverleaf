ZenOverleaf transform Overleaf and TexPage into a focused, distraction-free writing environment. ZenOverleaf adds unobtrusive buttons to your editor toolbar, allowing you to instantly toggle the sidebar, header, and UI clutter to maximize your writing space.


**Key Features:**
* **Private and Reliable:** ZenOverleaf does all the computation and modification within your own computer. It does not collect any personal data and does not link to *any* other websites and IPs.
* **Git Backup (New feature since v2.0.0):** Support one-side backup to git remote repo (github, gitee, cnb.cool, ...), with the help of [`isomorphic-git`](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git), a pure JavaScript reimplementation of git.
* **Maximize Screen Real Estate:** Perfect for laptop users or split-screen workflows where every pixel counts.
  * **Toggle UI Elements:** Individually show or hide the file tree sidebar, the top header bar, and the line-number gutter.
  * **True Fullscreen:** One-click activation of browser-level fullscreen mode for deep work sessions.
  * **Dual Platform Support:** Works seamlessly on both **Overleaf** and **TexPage**.
  * **Native Integration:** The "Zen-class" buttons are styled to match the native toolbar of the editor, ensuring they look like they belong there.

Whether you are drafting a thesis, a research paper, or a resume, ZenOverleaf helps you focus on what matters most: your content.
